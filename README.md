# Cricket-Prediction-IPL
It is very hard to pick a team of 11 from a pool of 30 players for a match. It is even hard to pick those 30 players according to your needs like our home ground, the players you are retaining, maximum money you can spend. Predicting the chances a particular team has to win a match, or an arbitrary team has to win maximum number of matches they can to qualify for Knock-outs. Problems we would face are ranging from collecting the data related to every match and ball of IPL and other major T-20 events across the globe. Reducing the complexity of that data. Modelling the prediction based on the parameters we are defining.
Using a supervised learning approach from a team composition perspective, it is suggested that the relative team strength between the competing teams forms a distinctive feature for predicting the winner. Modeling the team strength boils down to modeling individual playerâ€™s batting and bowling performances, forming the basis of our approach. Using the career statistics as well as the recent performances of a player to model the details and painting a picture. Player independent factors have also been considered in order to predict the outcome of a match. Supervised learning and deep learning techniques would be used. PCA is good technique to reduce the complexity of the data. Some data would be missing so data smoothing techniques could be used.
